One feature of Sass that's different than CSS is it uses variables. They are declared and set to store data, similar to JavaScript.

In JavaScript, variables are defined using the let and const keywords. In Sass, variables start with a $ followed by the variable name.

$main-fonts: Arial, sans-serif;
$headings-color: green;

//To use variables:
h1 {
  font-family: $main-fonts;
  color: $headings-color;
}

One example where variables are useful is when a number of elements need to be the same color. If that color is changed, the only place to edit the code is the variable value.

<style type='text/scss'>
  
  // The SASS variable.
  $text-color: red;

  .header{
    text-align: center;
  }
  .blog-post, h2 {
    color: $text-color;  // The SASS variable being referred to!
  }
</style>

<h1 class="header">Learn Sass</h1>
<div class="blog-post">
  <h2>Some random title</h2>
  <p>This is a paragraph with some random text in it</p>
</div>
<div class="blog-post">
  <h2>Header #2</h2>
  <p>Here is some more random text.</p>
</div>
<div class="blog-post">
  <h2>Here is another header</h2>
  <p>Even more random text within a paragraph</p>
</div>
