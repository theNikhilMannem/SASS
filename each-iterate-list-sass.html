The last challenge showed how the @for directive uses a starting and ending value to loop a certain number of times. Sass also offers the @each directive which loops over each item in a list or map. On each iteration, the variable gets assigned to the current value from the list or map.

@each $color in blue, red, green {
  .#{$color}-text {color: $color;}
}
A map has slightly different syntax. Here's an example:

$colors: (color1: blue, color2: red, color3: green);

@each $key, $color in $colors {
  .#{$color}-text {color: $color;}
}
Note that the $key variable is needed to reference the keys in the map. Otherwise, the compiled CSS would have color1, color2... in it. Both of the above code examples are converted into the following CSS:

.blue-text {
  color: blue;
}

.red-text {
  color: red;
}

.green-text {
  color: green;
}

<style type='text/scss'>
  
  @each $color in blue, black, red {
    .#{$color}-bg {
      background-color: $color;
    }
  }

  div {
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
  }
</style>

<div class="blue-bg"></div>
<div class="black-bg"></div>
<div class="red-bg"></div>
