Sass allows nesting of CSS rules, which is a useful way of organizing a style sheet.

Normally, each element is targeted on a different line to style it, like so:

nav {
  background-color: red;
}

nav ul {
  list-style: none;
}

nav ul li {
  display: inline-block;
}
For a large project, the CSS file will have many lines and rules. This is where nesting can help organize your code by placing child style rules within the respective parent elements:

nav {
  background-color: red;

  ul {
    list-style: none;

    li {
      display: inline-block;
    }
  }
}

-->


<style type='text/scss'>
  
  // The element that nests.
  .blog-post {
    
    // The element that is nested.
    h1 {
      text-align: center;
      color: blue;
    }
    
    // The element that is nested.
    p {
      font-size: 20px;
    }
  }
</style>

<div class="blog-post">
  <h1>Blog Title</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
</div>
